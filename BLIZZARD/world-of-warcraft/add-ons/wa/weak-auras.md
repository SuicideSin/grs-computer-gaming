# Weak Auras

This an introduction to Weak Auras 2, a WoW Add-On that keeps track of:

* buffs
* debuffs
* cooldowns
* spell duration
* much, much more!

## Basics

### Open Weak Auras

There is generally a ticker menu in your minimap that you can use. Otherwise, type this in chat:

```chat
/wa
```

Once you get started, you can import and export Weak Aura other players WA strings or configrations that you may like.

## Universal Options and Considerations

* Display
    + This is the only one that's different. The other four are essentially the same everywhere.
* Trigger
    + When should the Aura activate?
    + The most common way you'll complete this is upon cliking __Apply Template__

* Load
* Actions
* Animations
